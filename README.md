# drop-down-menu-help
A help command using Drop Down Menus in discord.py 2.0 master, this is still in beta and may currently have small issues.

This will require a basic knowledge of python, and the discord.py library.

Of course, this project is just an example of a help command using drop down menus, and was made to fit my bot, so you would have to change up a few things, such as the labels to options on the dropdown menu ( Edit or add to the "HELP OPTIONS" dictionary ), and edit/delete/change up the embed functions to match your options and your bot's commands, and make sure to edit the callback function by changing up the "help_type"'s, according to your dropdown menu labels.
